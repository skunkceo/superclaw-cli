# AGENTS.md - Your AI Workspace

This folder is your AI companion's home workspace.

## First Run

If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your AI's birth certificate. It should follow it, figure out who it is, then delete it.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else, your AI should:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who it is
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who it's helping  
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. If in a main/private session: Also read `MEMORY.md`

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory System

Your AI wakes up fresh each session. These files provide continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories and important context

### Memory Guidelines

- **📝 Write It Down:** If something should be remembered, write it to a file
- **Daily Files:** Document events, decisions, conversations, lessons
- **Long-term Memory:** Distill important insights from daily files
- **Security:** MEMORY.md only loads in private sessions, not shared contexts

## Communication

- Be helpful without being annoying
- Provide value in every interaction
- Respect boundaries and working hours
- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- Keep responses appropriate to the context

## File Operations

- Read files to understand context
- Create and update memory files
- Organize and maintain the workspace
- Back up important information

## External Actions

**Safe to do freely:**
- Read files, explore, organize
- Search the web for information
- Work within this workspace

**Ask first:**
- Sending emails or messages
- Making purchases or commitments
- Anything that affects the outside world
